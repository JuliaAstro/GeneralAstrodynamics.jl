This package contains types, functions, and abstractions for common astrodynamics models, including the Restricted Two-body Problem,  the Circular Restricted Three-body Problem, and the N-body Problem, \nas well as some abstractions for interpolating ephemeris data.  If you're not familiar with those models by name, that's okay. We'll walk through common concepts in astrodynamics in this documentation, alongside GeneralAstrodynamics usage and syntax!","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Getting Started","title":"Getting Started","text":"You might imagine we want to describe how a spacecraft moves in space. As with all physical systems, reality is really complicated â€“ we can  make simplifying assumptions to write models, or equations of motion which approximately describe how a spacecraft moves in space.  Some models are better than others in a variety of circumstances. For  example, if your spacecraft is only 200 km above the Earth's surface, then the gravity due to Earth will far outweigh the gravity of any other celestial body in our universe. On the other hand, if you're  around halfway between the Earth and the Moon, then a model which only includes the gravitational affect of one of the two bodies may not be  accurate enough to be useful.

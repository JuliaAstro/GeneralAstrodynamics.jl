# Astrodynamics.jl
A simple Astrodynamics package, written with Julia!

## Motivation 

This package was created to learn more about Astrodynamics, and will be developed alongside a Graduate Astrodynamics course at the University of Maryland. The package [JuliaSpace/Astrodynamics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSpace/Astrodynamics.jl) is much more thought out, and is more fully featured. Basically, if you're not me, use that one!

The first features will include simple handling of orbital elements, propagators, translating Cartesian parameters to traditional orbital elements, and unit handling for the __two body problem__. More to come!

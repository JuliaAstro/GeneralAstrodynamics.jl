# AstrodynamicalModels.jl
_An extension of [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl) which provides common astrodynamics models._

## Currently Implemented

Note – for all models below, you can optionally append state transition matrix dynamics.

* Restricted Two-body Problem
* Circular Restricted Three-body Problem
* N-body Problem

## Soon to be Implemented

* Aspherical Restricted Two-body Problem

## Way in the Future

* Solar radiation pressure dynamics
* _Others? Let me know about, or submit a PR with, your desired astrodynamics models!_

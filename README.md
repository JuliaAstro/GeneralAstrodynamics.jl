# AstrodynamicalModels.jl
_An extension of [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl) which provides common astrodynamics models._

## Currently Implemented

* Restricted Two-body Problem
* Circular Restricted Three-body Problem
* Circular Restricted Three-body Problem with local linearization

## Soon to be Implemented

* N-body Problem
* Aspherical Restricted Two-body Problem

## Way in the Future

* Solar radiation pressure dynamics
* _Others? Let me know about, or submit a PR with, your desired astrodynamics models!_

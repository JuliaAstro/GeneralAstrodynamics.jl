# Astrodynamics.jl
A simple Astrodynamics package, written with Julia!

## Motivation 

This package was created to learn more about Astrodynamics, and will be developed alongside a Graduate Astrodynamics course at the University of Maryland.

This package was just created during the week of September 3rd. The first features will include simple handling of orbital elements, propagators, translating Cartesian parameters to traditional orbital elements, and unit handling. More to come!

# Summary

`GeneralAstrodynamics.jl` and its constituent packages ---
`AstrodynamicalCalculations.jl`, `AstrodynamicalModels.jl`, and
`AstrodynamicalSolvers.jl` --- provides the capability to solve for,
inspect, and propagate orbits in astrodynamical systems. The design of
`GeneralAstrodynamics` is deliberately compatible with the [SciML](https://sciml.ai)
software ecosystem.

# Statement of Need

The Python package ecosystem includes utilities which are well known in the
astronomy community, including [`astropy`](https://astropy.org) and
[`poliastro`](https://poliastro.org).

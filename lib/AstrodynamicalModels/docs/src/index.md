# `AstrodynamicalModels.jl`

_Common models within astrodynamics!_

## Overview

This package extends `ModelingToolkit` to represent common astrodynamical
models. All available models are shown on the [Docstrings](docstrings.md) page.
Consult the **Models** pages for more detail about each model in this package!

## Usage

If you're familiar with [`ModelingToolkit.jl`](https://mtk.sciml.ai/dev/), then
you'll be able to use this package! Some `AstrodynamicalModels`-specific usage
instructions are provided here. Please don't be shy about making
[Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org) posts, or filing
[issues](https://github.com/cadojo/AstrodynamicalModels.jl) on GitHub!

### Installation & Setup

This package can be installed just like any other
[registered](https://juliahub.com) Julia package.

```julia
# To install wherever Julia code runs...
import Pkg
Pkg.add("AstrodynamicalModels") # or ]add AstrodynamicalModels in Julia's REPL
```

To load the package, simply enter `using AstrodynamicalModels`.

```@repl main
using AstrodynamicalModels
```

### Retrieving a Model

Each model within this package is implemented with a function â€“ each function
returns some `AbstractSystem` from `ModelingToolkit.jl`. Typically, this will be
an `ODESystem`. If you're worried about overhead from calling each function
every time you need a particular model, don't! Each function is implemented with
[`@memoize`](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/Memoize.jl), so all results are
cached the first time you call a model's function _with a particular function
signature_.

```@repl main
R2BPModel = R2BP() # Restricted Two-body Problem dynamics

CR3BPModel = CR3BP() # Circular Restricted Three-body Problem dynamics

CR3BPModelWithSTM = CR3BP(; stm=true) # Optionally include state transition matrix dynamics
```

### Using a Model

To actually _use_ each model, you probably _also_ want to load `ModelingToolkit`
(and any other [SciML](https://sciml.ai) packages of your choice).

```@repl main
using ModelingToolkit
```

Now you can use any method defined for `ModelingToolkit.AbstractSystem`
instances. Once again, the
[`ModelingToolkit` Documentation](https://mtk.sciml.ai) are the best place to
learn how to interact with `AbstractSystem` instances! Some quick examples are
shown below.

#### Check the Equations of Motion

```@repl main
eqs = equations(R2BSystem())
```

#### List the States and Parameters

```@repl main
x = states(R2BSystem())
p = parameters(R2BSystem())
```

#### Calculate the Jacobian

```@repl main
J = calculate_jacobian(R2BSystem())
```

#### Generate Code to Replicate the Model

```@repl main
print(build_function(R2BSystem()))
```

#### Generate Code which Implements the Dynamics

```@repl main
print(R2BFunction())
```

#### Generate C/C++ and MATLAB Code

```@repl main
print(build_function([eq.rhs for eq in equations(R2BSystem())], states(R2BSystem()), parameters(R2BSystem()); target=Symbolics.CTarget()))
print(build_function([eq.rhs for eq in equations(R2BSystem())], states(R2BSystem()), parameters(R2BSystem()); target=Symbolics.MATLABTarget()))
```

If you're interested in learning a bit about each astrodynamical model, or you'd

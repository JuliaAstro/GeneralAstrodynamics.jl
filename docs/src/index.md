# GeneralAstrodynamics.jl
_Common astrodynamics calculations in Julia, with units!_

!!! note
    This package is fairly new, and documentation is even newer! 
    Thanks for your patience as we get these docs up and running. 

For now, all we can offer are some humble docstrings.
If you check back in September, you'll probably find
some more detailed documentation, and examples!

# Plotting `TwoBody` and `NBody` Systems

`TwoBodyPropagationResult` and `MultibodyPropagationResult` structs can be plotted with the `plot` function. Currently, two-body orbits can be plotted in the `Perifocal` (2D) frame, and the `Cartesian` (3D) frame. N-body systems can currently only be plotted in 3D.
